     <h3> <li>Human action recognisation using lstm and cnn</li></h3>
    <p>Human action recognition in videos is a challenging task crucial for various applications like surveillance and healthcare monitoring. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features, limiting their ability to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns. In contrast, our proposed deep learning approach combines LSTM networks and CNNs for robust action recognition. LSTM networks excel in capturing temporal dynamics and long-range dependencies in video sequences. CNNs are adept at extracting spatial features from individual frames, enhancing the model's discriminative power. By integrating LSTM and CNN architectures, our system achieves superior performance in recognizing diverse human actions. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark datasets, promising advancements in video understanding systems. This project contributes to the broader field of deep learning by leveraging hierarchical representations of spatial and temporal features. The proposed architecture holds potential for real-world applications requiring accurate and efficient action recognition in videos.</p>

        <h3> Project Description:</h3>
        The main objective of this project
        is to generate descriptions of a given image, i.e., to
        capture the relationship between objects present in the
        image, it generalizes object detection when the description
        when the description consists of a single word.

    <p>The Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner, 
        a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, 
        Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name 
        written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.
        [2] The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the 
        daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.
